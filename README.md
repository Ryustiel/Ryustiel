- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ryustiel
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and in understanding the issues that the existing training algorithms are trying to solve.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematics and computer science (as an college student)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now since i'm still in the process of learning the basics
- 📫 How to reach me : you probably wouldn't want. (but try raph.ny@outlook.fr if you want to send funny memes)
