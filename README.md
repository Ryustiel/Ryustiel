- 👋 Hi, I’m Ryustiel
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and I want to achieve designing training algorithms fit to specific problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mathematics and computer science as a college student.
- 💞️ I’m not ready to collaborate on any non educational project for now, since i'm still learning the basics.
- 📫 How to reach me : you probably wouldn't, but raph.ny@outlook.fr is gonna be working so you can send funny memes
